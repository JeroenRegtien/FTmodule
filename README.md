# FTmodule

Arduino Library to control legacy parallel and serial fischertechnik(r) computing interfaces.

Original code by Jeroen Regtien, 
December 2023 with revisions since. 
  
Supported Parallel interfaces: Universal (30520), CVK (66843), Centronics(30566) 

Supported Serial interface: Intelligent (30402), ROBO (93293)

Supported Controllino PLCs: MINI, MAXI Automation, MICRO

Supported Shields: Dicacta UNO, Didacta MEGA, Adafruit Motorshield, ftNano shield

Supported Arduino's: UNO R3, UNO R4 (Minima/Wifi), MEGA, Nano
 
 The library consists of two files:
 FTmodule.h - header file for the FTmodule, FTcontroller and FTtimer class 
 
 FTmodule.cpp - C++ implementation of class, methods and utility functions

    Version 0.6 - Added LCD 2004 option.
    Version 0.7 - Serial extension capability, code cleanup, add actuators, lamps.
    Version 0.8 - Used for several workstations. Actuators removed as object.
    Version 0.9 - Parallel Extensions added. Analog input via parallel interface now works.
                Consolidated and rationalised. Given Arduino UNO memory limitations,
                two separate classes introduced: FTlegacy for legacy fischertechnik
                interfaces and FTmodule also including 3rd party shields and controllers.
                Version after many prototype tests.
    Version 1.0 - First operational release. Added FTstepper(XY) and FTencoder classes
